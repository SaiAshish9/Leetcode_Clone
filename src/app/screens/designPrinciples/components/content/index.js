          SOLID is a structured design approach that ensures your software is
          modular and easy to maintain, understand, debug, and refactor.
          Following SOLID also helps save time and effort in both development
          and maintenance. SOLID prevents your code from becoming rigid and
          fragile, which helps you build long-lasting software.

        <Text m>Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</Text>
        <Text>
          Every class in Java should have a single job to do. To be precise,
          there should only be one reason to change a class.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Each class should be responsible for a single part or functionality of
          the system.
        </Text>
        <Text>Example 1:</Text>
        <Editor
          height={"8.5rem"}
          value={`public class Task {
   public void downloadFile(String location);
   public void parseTheFile(File file);
   public void persistTheData(Data data);
}`}
        />
        <Text>
          we can't reuse above code anywhere else and hence it doesn't meet
          single responsibility principle.
        </Text>
        <Text>Example 2:</Text>
        <Editor
          height={"8.5rem"}
          value={`public class Employee {
   public Money calculatePay()
   public String reportHours()
   public void save()
}
`}
        />
        <Text>This is also a class with multiple responsibilities.</Text>
        <Text>Example 3:</Text>
        <Editor
          height={"8.5rem"}
          value={`public class Vehicle {
   public void printDetails() {}
   public double calculateValue() {}
   public void addVehicleToDB() {}
}`}
        />
        <Text>
          The Vehicle class has three separate responsibilities: reporting,
          calculation, and database. By applying SRP, we can separate the above
          class into three classes with separate responsibilities.
        </Text>
        <Text>Example 4:</Text>

          Software entities (e.g., classes, modules, functions) should be open

        <Text>
          Suppose we now want to add another subclass called Truck. We would
          have to modify the above class by adding another if statement, which
          goes against the Open-Closed Principle.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          A better approach would be for the subclasses Car and Truck to
          override the calculateValue method:

        return this.getValue() * 0.9;
}}`}

        <Text>
          The above classes do not obey LSP because you cannot replace the
          Rectangle base class with its derived class Square. <br />
          The Square class has extra constraints, i.e., the height and width
          must be the same.
          <br />
          Therefore, substituting Rectangle with Square class may result in
          unexpected behavior.
